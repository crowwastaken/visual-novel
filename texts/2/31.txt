Kuro: I decided talk to Akia.: 00
Kuro: I stand in front of Akia.: 00
Kuro: "Why're you in the corner of the boy's locker room weeping..?": 00
Akia: "Huh? Why're you here... go away.": 00
Kuro: "Hey, it's not like I'm gonna rat you out, I just came to ask why the Class Prez is on the floor.": 00
Akia: "The Headmaster's mocking my job.. It's not like I had another option.": 00
Akia: "The job actually doesn't pay well, it's just that I need the tips to actually gain money.": 00
Akia: "Why're you interested anyway, just leave me be...": 00
Kuro: "I guess... it can be rough. I'm sure it'll be fine. Anyways, I gotta head out.": 00
Akia: ...: 00
Kuro: I leave the boy's locker room after changing shoes.: 00
Kuro: I can't help but think about what happened in the locker room.: 00
Kuro: What an interesting girl, I can't help but wonder what she does in that job of hers.: 00
Kuro: Maybe I should head to that new Maid cafe to clear my mind.: 00
Kuro: I keep wondering what happened between the headmaster and Akia.: 00
Kuro: What was she doing in the boy's locker room?
Kuro: What an interesting girl. She told headmaster she was working at a cafe...?: 00
Kuro: I arrive at the Maid Cafe, only to be greeted by several maids.: 00
Maids: "Irasshaimase, shushin-sama.": 00
Maids: The maids bow in unison.: 00
Kuro: I stumble back.: 00
Maids: "Please choose one of us, shushin-sama!": 00
Kuro: I see Akia in catgirl ears, gritting her teeth while bowing.: 00
Kuro: She seems angry from my presence.: 00
Kuro: She also needs the tips due to her financial situation, right?.: 00
Kuro: "I'll choose Akia.": 00
Akia: "Thanks for choosing me, shushin-sama n-nya..!": 00
Kuro: I follow her as she guides me to the table.: 00
Kuro: I need to explain myself...: 00
