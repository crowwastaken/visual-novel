Kuro: I'll just quickly change my shoes and leave.: 00
Kuro: I ignore the weeping sounds, change shoes, and leave the school.: 00
Kuro: I walk home, and encounter your best friend, Kaito Yamamoto.: 00
Kaito: "Hey Kuro! Nice seeing you here!": 00
Kuro: "Hey.": 00
Kaito: "Actually the reason I’ve come to talk to you here is because a Maid Cafe just opened up! Not that many people are in there though, so we should totally go together today!": 00
Kuro: "Uhm, I really need to go home Kaito, gotta go to the washroom.": 00
Kuro: In the end, I was forcefully dragged to the Cafe by Kaito.: 00
Kaito's phone: *Ring ring!*: 00
Kaito: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Woah?! Seriously?!: 00
Kaito: Sorry bud, I gotta catch this dungeon, maybe next time. Tell me how it is though!: 00
Kuro: Ah Kaito, so indecisive.: 00
Kuro: Welp, since I'm here, I might as well enjoy myself.: 00
Kuro: I keep wondering what happened between the headmaster and Akia.: 00
Kuro: What an interesting girl. She told headmaster she was working at a cafe...?: 00
Kuro: I arrive at the Maid Cafe, only to be greeted by several maids.: 00
Maids: "Irasshaimase, shushin-sama.": 00
Maids: The maids bow in unison.: 00
Kuro: I stumble back.: 00
Maids: "Please choose one of us, shushin-sama!": 00
Kuro: I see Akia in catgirl ears, gritting her teeth while bowing.: 00
Kuro: She seems angry from my presence.: 00
Kuro: She also needs the tips due to her financial situation, right?.: 00
Kuro: "I'll choose Akia.": 00
Akia: "Thanks for choosing me, shushin-sama n-nya..!": 00
Kuro: I follow her as she guides me to the table.: 00
Kuro: I need to explain myself...: 00
