Kuro: I should help her out...: 00
Kuro: I slowly approach Akia and sit next to her.: 00
Kuro: "Akia... Why are you in the boy's locker room? What happened?": 00
Akia: "Huh? Why're you here... go away.": 00
Kuro: "I'm sorry, I don't any mean intentions. I just came to ask why the Class Prez is on the floor.": 00
Akia: "The Headmaster's mocking my job.. It's not like I had another option.": 00
Akia: "The job actually doesn't pay well, it's just that I need the tips to actually gain money.": 00
Akia: "W-why're you interested anyway, just leave me be...": 00
Kuro: "I guess... it can be rough. Don't be too hard on yourself, I wish you luck!": 00
Akia: ...: 00
Kuro: I leave the boy's locker room after changing shoes.: 00
Kuro: I can't help but think about what happened in the locker room.: 00
Kuro: What an interesting girl, I can't help but wonder what she does in that job of hers.: 00
Kuro: Maybe I should walk around the city to clear my mind.: 00
Kuro: After walking around a block, I notice a Maid cafe.: 00
Kuro: Maybe that'll help out.: 00
Kuro: I still keep wondering what happened to Akia...: 00
Kuro: I arrive at the Maid Cafe, only to be greeted by several maids.: 00
Maids: "Irasshaimase, shushin-sama.": 00
Maids: The maids bow in unison.: 00
Kuro: I stumble back.: 00
Maids: "Please choose one of us, shushin-sama!": 00
Kuro: I see Akia in catgirl ears, gritting her teeth while bowing.: 00
Kuro: She seems angry from my presence.: 00
Kuro: This was her job? She needs help with tips, right?: 00
Kuro: "I'll choose Akia.": 00
Akia: "Thanks for choosing me, shushin-sama n-nya..!": 00
Kuro: I follow her as she guides me to the table.: 00
Kuro: I need to explain myself...: 00
