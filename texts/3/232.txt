Akia: "Here's your order, sir.": 00
Kuro: "Thanks.": 00
Kuro: I finish eating, and can't help but wonder what decisions led me to go to a maid cafe. A maid cafe of all places.: 00
Kuro: I stare blankly into the distance for an hour as if I had amnesia.: 00
Akia: "Sir, other people are waiting for a seat. If you're finished with your meal, I'd advise leaving the cafe. Come again soon though.": 00
Kuro: "All right, goodbye.": 00
Kuro: That girl isn't that interesting after all. I guess I'll just walk home now.: 00
Kuro: I walk home, with nothing gained and nothing lost. It was just another typical day in my average life.: 00
Kuro: *Proceeds to fall on his face on the cement*: 00
Kuro: "Ouch.. talk about bad luck.": 00
