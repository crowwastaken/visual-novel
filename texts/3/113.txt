Akia: W-what?: 00
Kuro: I mean, you wanted my money right, that's why you're working here.: 00
Akia: How rude. I hope you're joking.: 00
Other maid: Akia! Remember how a maid is supposed to treat their customers.: 00
Akia: Now, hurry up and give me your order.: 00
Kuro: I'll take a burger please.: 00
Akia. Which one...: 00
Kuro: The one that's the most expensive.: 00
Akia: *Rolls her eyes*: 00
Akia: Please wait a moment.: 00
Time: *Passes*: 00
Kuro: "Thanks for the food.": 00
Akia: "No problem, Kuro.": 00
Other Maid: "Hey Akia, why don't you go sit with your friend, your shift is almost over anyways, and I'll take care of everything from here.": 00
Akia: "Really? Thanks a lot!": 00
Akia: *Sits down next to Kuro*
Akia: "Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I'm happy you wanted to help me- no one's ever done that before.": 00
Kuro: "Ah no problem, it's the least I could do for the class president.": 00
: Kuro and Akia continued to talk about various events that went on in the classroom, and how their fellow classmates would contribute nothing to the class.
Kuro: "Hey it's getting pretty late, why don't I walk you back?": 00
Akia: "Sure, but technically I'll be walking you to my house.": 00
Kuro: "Huh?": 00
Akia: "After all you don't know where I live, haha.": 00
Kuro: "Oh.. haha.. Anyways let's get walking.": 00
Akia: "Mhm!": 00
Kuro: Is it just me or are those cat ears moving?: 00
Time: *Skips*: 00
Akia: "So I guess this is goodbye then.": 00
Kuro: "Ah, out of curiosity, are those cat ears and tail real?": 00
Akia: *Puts both of Kuro's hands on Akia's ears*: 00
Akia: *Blushes*: 00
Akia: "Well, now you know...": 00
Kuro: *Red face*: 00
Kuro: "Y-yeah...": 00
Akia: "Well, I've got to go now.": 00
Kuro: "S-see you tomorrow.": 00
Akia: Her soft lips quickly touches Kuro's cheeks before hastefully running into her house.: 00
Chinozaya: Congrats you got an imaginary girl to kiss you
