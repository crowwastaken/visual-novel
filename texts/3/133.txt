Akia: W-what?: 00
Kuro: I mean, you wanted my money right, that's why you're working here.: 00
Akia: How rude. I hope you're joking.: 00
Other maid: Akia! Remember how a maid is supposed to treat their customers.: 00
Akia: Now, hurry up and give me your order.: 00
Kuro: I'll take a burger please.: 00
Akia. Which one...: 00
Kuro: The one that's the most expensive.: 00
Akia: *Rolls her eyes*: 00
Akia: Please wait a moment.: 00
Time: *Passes*: 00
Akia: "Here's your order.": 00
Kuro: "That took pretty long to come here.": 00
Akia: "It was two minutes!": 00
Kuro: "Bad service.": 00
Akia: "Are you kidding me?! Is your brain so small that it thinks two minutes is equivalent to an hour?!": 00
Kuro: I glance around the room. The other customers' eyes trailed towards the scene of us arguing. Loud whispers erupted.: 00
?: "Wow, I can't believe a maid like that's been hired.": 00
?: "I know right, she should know her place as a simple employee.": 00
Kuro: "And those ears, wow, they look so real.": 00
Akia: "Why don't you mind your own business?": 00
Kuro: "All I'm saying is that it looks stupid.": 00
Kuro: *Proceeds to touch Akia's ears and tail*: 00
Akia: "Eh? Uwaghhh! Did you just touch my ears and tail?!": 00
Kuro: "Th-they're real?": 00
Akia: *Slaps Kuro across the cheek* : 00
Akia: "Yes they're real!": 00
Kuro: "Ouch...": 00
Other Maid: "Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to step out of this cafe for assaulting one of our maids.": 00
Kuro: "What? She liked that though.": 00
Other Maid: "Clearly, she did not.": 00
Kuro: "What if I touch them again.": 00
Other Maid: *Grabs Kuro forcefully and drags him outside of the cafe*: 00
Kuro: "Ugh- what the fuc-": 00
Akia: "Looks like I called them just in time.": 00
Police Officer: "Sir, I'm going to have to take you into custody for physical assault.": 00
Kuro: "What?! I was seeing if they were real!": 00
Police Officer: *Slams him into the back of the car*: 00
Akia: "Good riddance...": 00
