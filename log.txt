<html>Kuro: It was the last day of school and I had finished my exam early.<br/>Kuro: I gazed around the room and in my peripheral vision I could see a pencil that was spinning.<br/>Kuro: Out of curiosity I couldn't help but look at the owner of said pencil.<br/>Kuro: There she sat twirling her pencil and biting her hair the odd combination of sorts.<br/>Kuro: Her name was Akia Akako the class president.<br/>Kuro: In all honesty I was surprised she was able to maintain that position...<br/>Kuro: ...well because her grades had plummeted.<br/>PA System: "Akia Akako class 1-3 please report to the office immediately."<br/>Kuro: Is she really getting sent to the office because of her grades?<br/>Kuro: I sit quietly, waiting until everyone's done with their tests.<br/>Kuro: When time is finally up, I packed my necessities and left early to the boy's locker room to change shoes.<br/>Kuro: I hear a faint cry from a feminine voice near the locker room.<br/>Kuro: What a rather...<br/>Kuro: ...unsettling sound.<br/>Kuro: I can only feel sympathy for her.<br/>Kuro: I decide to take a peek to see who it is.<br/>Kuro: Akia?<br/>Kuro: Why is she here?<br/>Kuro: I should help her out...<br/>Kuro: I slowly approach Akia and sit next to her.<br/>
