<html>Kuro: It was the last day of school and I had finished my exam early.<br/>Kuro: I gazed around the room and in my peripheral vision I could see a pencil that was spinning.<br/>Kuro: Out of curiosity I couldn't help but look at the owner of said pencil.<br/>Kuro: There she sat twirling her pencil and biting her hair the odd combination of sorts.<br/>Kuro: Her name was Akia Akako the class president.<br/>Kuro: In all honesty I was surprised she was able to maintain that position...<br/>Kuro: ...well because her grades had plummeted.<br/>PA System: "Akia Akako class 1-3 please report to the office immediately."<br/>Kuro: Is she really getting sent to the office because of her grades?<br/>Kuro: "Teacher, may I use the washroom?"<br/>Kuro: Guess I'll have to make this eavesdrop quick.<br/>Kuro: I lean against a wall, only to hear the silent arguing of Akia and the Headmaster.<br/>Headmaster: "Akia, you know you can't keep up this position forever with your grades, you know that right?"<br/>
